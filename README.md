# How do citations to the work of Nobel Prize-winners change following the announcement of the Nobel Prize?

Using publication records collected by [Li et al (2018)](https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/6NJ5RN) for almost all Nobel laureates in physics, chemistry, and physiology or medicine from 1900 to 2016, plus data from [scite](https://scite.ai/) on more than 3 million citation statements to these articles, I attempt to analyze how the body of work of Nobel Prize winners is cited before vs after receiving the Nobel Prize.
