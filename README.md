# nobel_prize_citations
Using publication records collected by Li et al (2018) for almost all Nobel laureates in physics, chemistry, and physiology or medicine from 1900 to 2016, plus data from scite (scite.ai) on more than 3 million citation statements to these articles, I attempt to analyze how work of Nobel Prize winners is cited before vs after receiving the Nobel Prize.
